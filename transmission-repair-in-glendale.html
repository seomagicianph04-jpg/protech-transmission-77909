Highly recommend pro tech transmissions for your all your mechanical needs.",

Instead of calling me they proceeded to do work on my vehicle with out my consent nor did they wait to tell me everything that was wrong but instead tried to charge more after. He said he had my # down wrong well why work on my car if you didn't talk to me. I talked to MIKE and instead of trying to work something out and try to come to a conclusion he just said he didn't want my business and put my car down. I had to get it towd on my own and didn't use his tow man again. And when I went back to my car they had left my car on, unlocked, and my window down. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. if that's how you do business I don't want it. And I would have paid the price he gave me at first before he took my car apart. I'm glad I stood my ground and knew what was wrong from right!!! I would hate for someone else to go here with out any knowledge about a car they will definitely get over on you!! With their $135 a hour labor!!!! Jeffery the one who actually did the work I apologized that happened and I hope he still got paid for the job! But MIKE was definitely not one to talk to!!! He didn't take my money but he knew he was wrong to beginning with I've never been to a company where they just start working on a car without calling or hearing from the owner! Just took both axles off and tore one of my lugs.\n\nResponding to what was said NOOOOO MY ROTOR WASNT BROKEN!!! AND MIKE DIDNT FIX IT JEFFERY DID!! WHILE MIKE SAT HIS BUTT IN THE OFFICE!!! I BOUGHT ONE PART I HAD ALRESDY PURCHASED AND DIDNT TELL ANYONE TO WORK ON MY CAR NOR PUT ANY PARTS ON MY CAR HE DIDNT EVEN CALL TO TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG AND I WOULD HAVE ATLEAST HOPES BEFORE TAKING MY CAR OUT OF YOUR SHOP YOU WOULD HAVE LOCKED IT UP NOT JUST GIVE ME MY KEYS! UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!! AND MY SPOUSE DIDNT SO ANY WORK ON MY CAR!! SO STOP THE LIES! PLEASE BEWARE!! And i told you to put my car back when you had already took everything apart and didn't even put my other axle back on my car!!! Thanks for making it easier for thr right person to fix my car!!\n\nIn response...\nNo you had to do free work because you didnt get me to authorize you to do ANY WORK on my car I had to come up there to see you started and everything because yall claimed to have the wrong #! Which your tow man had my # as well and if you didnt get a answer you shouldn't have started!!! Poor on your part!! And look at you assuming who i got to do the work smh bad gesture on your part but my car is fixed now by a better company and actually called my phone to get it done right!! Happy holidays!",

They kept me informed through the process. Instead of trying to up sell me or make up false issues they gave it to me straight. They replaced the valves and filled up the system to the proper level. Any other place could have easily tried selling me a new hose or worse. Definitely a trustworthy shop. Thank you guys for your help!",

They have great customer service and I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in, plus I didn’t even have an appointment I just showed up. Highly recommend pro tech transmissions for your all your mechanical needs.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">If I could give this place a NO STAR I would!!! First off I had them get my car because of a broken axle. Instead of calling me they proceeded to do work on my vehicle with out my consent nor did they wait to tell me everything that was wrong but instead tried to charge more after. He said he had my # down wrong well why work on my car if you didn't talk to me. I talked to MIKE and instead of trying to work something out and try to come to a conclusion he just said he didn't want my business and put my car down. I had to get it towd on my own and didn't use his tow man again. And when I went back to my car they had left my car on, unlocked, and my window down. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. if that's how you do business I don't want it. And I would have paid the price he gave me at first before he took my car apart. I'm glad I stood my ground and knew what was wrong from right!!! I would hate for someone else to go here with out any knowledge about a car they will definitely get over on you!! With their $135 a hour labor!!!! Jeffery the one who actually did the work I apologized that happened and I hope he still got paid for the job! But MIKE was definitely not one to talk to!!! He didn't take my money but he knew he was wrong to beginning with I've never been to a company where they just start working on a car without calling or hearing from the owner! Just took both axles off and tore one of my lugs.

Responding to what was said NOOOOO MY ROTOR WASNT BROKEN!!! AND MIKE DIDNT FIX IT JEFFERY DID!! WHILE MIKE SAT HIS BUTT IN THE OFFICE!!! I BOUGHT ONE PART I HAD ALRESDY PURCHASED AND DIDNT TELL ANYONE TO WORK ON MY CAR NOR PUT ANY PARTS ON MY CAR HE DIDNT EVEN CALL TO TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG AND I WOULD HAVE ATLEAST HOPES BEFORE TAKING MY CAR OUT OF YOUR SHOP YOU WOULD HAVE LOCKED IT UP NOT JUST GIVE ME MY KEYS! UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!! AND MY SPOUSE DIDNT SO ANY WORK ON MY CAR!! SO STOP THE LIES! PLEASE BEWARE!!

                    <div class="testimonial-text">This place is great! I’m going to bring my mom’s car here too. I went in because I was having issues with my AC. The service was really fast and convenient. They kept me informed through the process. Instead of trying to up sell me or make up false issues they gave it to me straight. They replaced the valves and filled up the system to the proper level. Any other place could have easily tried selling me a new hose or worse. Definitely a trustworthy shop. Thank you guys for your help!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">After spending days and money to get a bolt off the trans fo the dipstick on a 2018” f150 I finally resorted to these guys who I kid you not got it off in 10 minutes. I was politely told that the technician was currently busy with the vehicle and then had to go on lunch, but then went out of their way to actually start Working on my car immediately, and I felt like I just sat down and they came out and told me that it was already almost done. Definitely a place. I’ll be coming back too if I ever Have transmission issues</div>
